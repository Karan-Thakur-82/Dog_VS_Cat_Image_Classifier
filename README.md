# Dog vs Cat Image Classification

### Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to classify images of dogs and cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled dog and cat images, enabling it to distinguish between the two with a high degree of accuracy. The project also includes a web-based interface built with Flask, where users can upload images to receive real-time predictions on whether the image contains a dog or a cat.

### Features
- **CNN-based Image Classification**: A Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the images as either a dog or a cat.
- **Flask Web App**: The project is deployed via a Flask web application that allows users to upload images and get predictions.
- **Real-Time Image Upload and Prediction**: Users can upload images through the web interface, and the app will return a classification result in real-time.
- **Model Training and Testing**: The model was trained using Keras and TensorFlow on the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset, achieving significant accuracy.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from the [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). It contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats, split into training, validation, and testing sets.

### Tech Stack
- **Python**: For model training and backend logic.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used to build and train the CNN model.
- **Flask**: Provides the web framework for the user interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend for the web app, enabling image upload and display of results.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing before feeding them into the model.

### How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images from the dataset are resized and normalized to ensure uniform input for the CNN model.
2. **Model Architecture**: 
   - The model consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by max-pooling layers and dense layers, which ultimately classify the image as a dog or cat.
   - The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function to handle binary classification.
3. **Training**: The model was trained on the Kaggle dataset using an 80-20 split between the training and test sets. A validation split was used to evaluate model performance during training.
4. **Deployment**: The trained model is saved and loaded into a Flask web app. Users can upload an image, and the app will predict whether it contains a dog or a cat.
5. **Prediction**: The model processes the uploaded image and returns a prediction with a confidence score (probability).

### Future Improvements
- **Enhance Model Accuracy**: The model can be further fine-tuned using transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet.
- **Model Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation strategies could help further improve the performance.
- **Improve User Interface**: The web app can be enhanced with better styling and more user-friendly features.
- **Deploy on Cloud**: The Flask app can be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud for public access.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network to solve a classic image classification problem and showcases how to integrate a machine learning model into a simple web application for real-world use.
